# There is some double Base64 encoding going on when a PowerShell script is
# given to a CMD to invoke. We're in a battle with Windows' CMD max length and
# that what these specs are trying to ensure. This does lead to some less than
# ideal "code golfing" to reduce the code payload, but at the end of the day
# it's easier to see the entire context of the code vs. uploading partial code
# fragements and calling them on the remote side (not to mention more expensive
# in terms of PowerShell invocations).
