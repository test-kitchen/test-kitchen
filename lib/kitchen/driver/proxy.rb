module Kitchen
  module Driver
    # Simple driver that proxies commands through to a test instance whose
    # lifecycle is not managed by Test Kitchen. This driver is useful for long-
    # lived non-ephemeral test instances that are simply "reset" between test
    # runs. Think executing against devices like network switches--this is why
    # the driver was created.
