    # @param cmd [String] command to be executed locally
    # @param options [Hash] additional configuration of command
    # @option options [TrueClass, FalseClass] :use_sudo whether or not to use
    #   sudo
    # @option options [String] :sudo_command custom sudo command to use.
    #   Default is "sudo -E".
    # @option options [String] :log_subject used in the output or log header
    #   for clarity and context. Default is "local".
    # @option options [String] :cwd the directory to chdir to before running
    #   the command
    # @option options [Hash] :environment a Hash of environment variables to
    #   set before the command is run. By default, the environment will
    #   *always* be set to `'LC_ALL' => 'C'` to prevent issues with multibyte
    #   characters in Ruby 1.8. To avoid this, use :environment => nil for
    #   *no* extra environment settings, or
    #   `:environment => {'LC_ALL'=>nil, ...}` to set other environment
    #   settings without changing the locale.
    # @option options [Integer] :timeout Numeric value for the number of
    #   seconds to wait on the child process before raising an Exception.
    #   This is calculated as the total amount of time that ShellOut waited on
    #   the child process without receiving any output (i.e., IO.select
    #   returned nil). Default is 60000 seconds. Note: the stdlib Timeout
    #   library is not used.
    # @return [String] the standard output of the command as a String
    # @raise [ShellCommandFailed] if the command fails
    # @raise [Error] for all other unexpected exceptions
