A Test-Kitchen *verifier* tests the configuration applied by the *provisioner*. This is most commonly a InSpec or ServerSpec, both of which are included in the ChefDK/Workstation.

Other verifiers:

* shell (built-in)
* [busser-bats](https://github.com/test-kitchen/busser-bats/)
* [kitchen-pester](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-pester/)
