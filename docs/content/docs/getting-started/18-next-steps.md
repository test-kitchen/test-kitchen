This concludes the getting started guide for Test Kitchen. Hopefully you are now more comfortable with Test Kitchen's basic usage, fundamental concepts, and a feel for a testing workflow.

From here, there are a few resources that can help you along your infrastructure testing journey:

* Jump in the `#test-kitchen` channel on [Chef Community Slack](https://community.chef.io/slack)
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues)
* Write a blog post describing getting started with Test Kitchen, or an interesting problem Test Kitchen has allowed you to solve

Everyone can contribute to making Test Kitchen better, including the documentation. If you've learned something and want to contribute, please [fork the docs](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/tree/main/docs) and open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)!
