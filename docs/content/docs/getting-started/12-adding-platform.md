Now that we have Ubuntu working, let's add support for CentOS to our cookbook. This shouldn't be too bad. Open `kitchen.yml` in your editor and the `centos-8` line to your platforms list so that it resembles:

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_infra

verifier:
  name: inspec

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-20.04
  - name: centos-8

suites:
  - name: default
    verifier:
      inspec_tests:
        - test/integration/default
    attributes:
```

Now let's check the status of our instances:

```ruby
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action    Last Error
default-ubuntu-2004  Vagrant  ChefInfra     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
default-centos-8     Vagrant  ChefInfra     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
```

We're going to use two shortcuts in the next command:

* Each instance has a simple state machine that tracks where it is in its lifecycle. Given its current state and the desired state, the instance is smart enough to run all actions in between current and desired.
* Any `kitchen` subcommand that takes an instance name as an argument can take a Ruby regular expression that will be used to glob a list of instances together. This means that `kitchen test ubuntu` would run the **test** action on all instances that had `ubuntu` in their name. Note that the **list** subcommand also takes the regex-globbing argument so feel free to experiment there.

In our next example we'll select the `default-centos-8` instance with simply `8` and will take it from uncreated to verified in one command.

Let's see how CentOS runs our cookbook:

Nice! We've verified that our cookbook works on Ubuntu 20.04 and CentOS 8. Since the CentOS instance is no longer needed, let's destroy it for now:

```ruby
$ kitchen destroy
-----> Starting Test Kitchen (v3.2.2)
-----> Destroying <default-ubuntu-2004>...
       Finished destroying <default-ubuntu-2004> (0m0.00s).

       Vagrant instance <default-centos-8> destroyed.
       Finished destroying <default-centos-8> (0m7.11s).
-----> Test Kitchen is finished. (0m8.76s)
```

Interesting. Test Kitchen tried to destroy both instances, one that was created and the other that was not. Which brings us to another tip with the `kitchen` command:

**Any `kitchen` subcommand without an instance argument will apply to all instances.**

Let's make sure everything has been destroyed:

```ruby
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action    Last Error
default-ubuntu-2004  Vagrant  ChefInfra     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
default-centos-8     Vagrant  ChefInfra     Inspec    Ssh        <Not Created>  <None>
```
