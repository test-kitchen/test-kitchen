Test Kitchen is best understood through hands-on experience. In this guide, you'll use Test Kitchen to create a simple Chef Infra cookbook, complete with tests that ensure your cookbook works as intended. Test Kitchen encourages a test-driven development (TDD) workflow: write the tests first, watch them fail, then implement code to make them pass. This cycle—commonly known as *red, green, refactor*—helps you build reliable, maintainable software. By following along, you'll become comfortable with this approach and see how Test Kitchen streamlines cookbook development.
