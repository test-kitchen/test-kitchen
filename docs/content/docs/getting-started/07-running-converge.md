Now that we have a recipe, let's use `kitchen converge` to see if it works:

If you are a Chef Infra user then part of the output above should look familiar to you. Here's what happened at a high level:

* Chef Infra Client was installed on the instance
* The `git_cookbook` files and a minimal Chef Infra Client configuration were built and uploaded to the instance
* A Chef Infra Client run was initiated using the run-list and node attributes specified in the `kitchen.yml` file

Looking closely at the run, there are two important things we want to note: git was already installed as part of the base image so Chef Infra Client reports `(up to date)` as it didn't have to do anything.

<div class="callout">
<h3 class="callout--title">Pro Tip</h3>
This highlights a property of configuration management systems, like Chef Infra, called <b>idempotence</b> - in this context, Chef Infra Client saw that we requested to install git but as it was already installed there was nothing to do. This concept is very useful when thinking about configuration management generally as unlike a bash script, Chef Infra cookbooks aren't a series of commands but a set of declarations about the desired state.

A **converge** will leave the machine running and kitchen automatically uploads changes each converge so that one can iterate rapidly on configuration code. A lot of time and effort has gone into ensuring that the exit code of kitchen is always appropriate. Here is the Test Kitchen Command Guarantee:

* I will always exit with code **0** if my operation was successful.
* I will always exit with a non-zero code if **any** part of my operation was not successful.
* Any behavior to the contrary **is a bug**.

This exit code behavior is a fundamental prerequisite for any tool working in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.
