kitchen-ec2 is a Test Kitchen *driver* for EC2 in Amazon AWS.

### Setting Driver Configuration

The Amazon AWS driver for Test Kitchen includes many configuration options that can be set globally in the driver section of your kitchen.yml config file or within each platform configuration. Global settings apply to all platforms in the `kitchen.yml`, while platform level driver configuration is applied to only those platforms and override globally set configuration options. Even if you use platform level configuration options, it's a good idea to specify the driver you use to use globally.

#### Example Global Driver Option

This configuration sets the driver to `ec2` and then sets the `some_config` configuration to true.

```yaml
driver:
  name: ec2
  some_config: true
```

#### Example Platform Driver Option

This configuration sets the driver to `ec2` globally and then sets the `some_config` configuration to true for just `ubuntu-20`.

```yaml
driver:
  name: ec2

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-20
    driver:
      some_config: true
```

### AWS Authentication

In order to connect to AWS, you must specify AWS credentials. We rely on the SDK to find credentials in the standard way, documented here: <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/#configuration>

The SDK Chain will search environment variables, then config files, then IAM role data from the instance profile, in that order. In the case config files being present, the 'default' profile will be used unless `shared_credentials_profile` is defined to point to another profile.

Because the Test Kitchen test should be checked into source control and ran through CI we no longer support storing the AWS credentials in the `.kitchen.yml` file.

### Instance Login Configuration

The instances you create use credentials you specify which are *separate* from the AWS credentials. Generally, SSH and WinRM use an AWS key pair which you specify.

#### SSH

The `aws_ssh_key_id` value is the name of the AWS key pair you want to use.

The value can be one of:

* `nil` (default)

By default the key ID is read from the `AWS_SSH_KEY_ID` environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, the value will be nil. In this case, a temporary key will be created for you (**>= 2.1.0**).

* `name_of_some_existing_aws_key_pair`

By setting the environment variable `AWS_SSH_KEY_ID` or by setting the `aws_ssh_key_id` driver option in kitchen.yml. This will be the key that becomes associated with the test EC2 instances. The key must already exist in AWS. To see a list of existing key pair IDs in a region, use the `aws` CLI tool. For example, in the US-East-1 region: `aws ec2 describe-key-pairs --region us-east-1`.

* `_disable`

This will not directly associate the EC2 instance with an AWS-managed key pair (pre-existing or auto-generated). This may be useful in environments that have disabled AWS-managed keys. Getting SSH keys onto the instance then becomes an exercise for the reader, though it can be done, for example, with scripting in `user_data` or if the credentials are already baked into the AMI.

When using an existing key, either an AWS-managed key pair or keys that exist on the instance through some other means, ensure that the private key is configured in your Test Kitchen `transport` section, either directly or made available via `ssh-agent`:

```yaml
transport:
  ssh_key: ~/.ssh/mykey.pem
```

For standard platforms we automatically provide the SSH username, but when specifying your own AMI you may need to configure that as well.

#### WinRM

For Windows instances the generated Administrator password is fetched automatically from Amazon EC2 with the same private key as we use for SSH.

Unfortunately the RDP file format does not allow including login credentials, so `kitchen login` with WinRM cannot automatically log in for you.

### Driver Configuration Options

#### Specifying the Image

There are three ways to specify the image you use for the instance: the `image_id`, `image_search` and `platform` name.

##### *image_id*

`image_id` can be set explicitly. It must be an ami in the region you are working with!

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: centos-7
    driver:
      image_id: ami-96a818fe
```

image_id's have a format like ami-748e2903. The image_id values appear next to the image names when you select 'Launch Instance' from the AWS EC2 console. You can also see the list from the AWS CLI ````aws ec2 describe-images````.

##### *image_search*

`image_search` lets you specify a series of key/value pairs to search for the image. If a value is set to an array, then *any* of those values will match. You can learn more about the available filters in the AWS CLI doc under `--filters` [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html).

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-14.04
    driver:
      image_search:
        owner-id: "099720109477"
        name: ubuntu/images/*/ubuntu-*-14.04*
```

In the event that there are multiple matches (as sometimes happens), we sort to get the best results. In order of priority from greatest to least, we prefer:

* HVM images over paravirtual
* SSD support over magnetic drives
* 64-bit over 32-bit
* The most recently created image (to pick up patch releases)

Note that the image_search method *requires* that the AMI image names be in a specific format.
Some examples are:

* Windows-2012
* Windows-2012r2
* Windows-2012r2sp1
* RHEL-7.2

It is safest to use the same naming convention as used by the public images published by the OS vendors on the AWS marketplace.

##### *platform* Name

The third way to specify the image is by leaving `image_id` and `image_search` blank, and specifying a standard platform name.

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-14.04
```

If you use the platform name `ubuntu`, `windows`, `rhel`, `debian`, `centos`, `freebsd` or `fedora`, kitchen-ec2 will search for the latest matching official image of the given OS in your region. You may leave versions off, specify partial versions, and you may specify architecture to distinguish 32- and 64-bit. Some examples:

```yaml
platforms:
  # The latest stable minor+patch release of rhel 6
  - name: rhel-6
  # The latest patch release of CentOS 6.3
  - name: centos-6.3
  # The latest patch release of Amazon Linux 2017.03
  - name: amazon-2017.03
  # The latest patch release of Amazon Linux 2 2018
  - name: amazon2-2018
  # 32-bit version of latest major+minor+patch release of Ubuntu
  - name: ubuntu-i386
  # 32-bit version of Debian 6
  - name: debian-6-i386
  # Latest 32-bit stable minor release of freebsd 10
  - name: freebsd-10-i386
  # The latest stable major+minor+patch release of Fedora
  - name: fedora
  # The most recent service-pack for Windows 2012 (not R2)
  - name: windows-2012
  # The most recent service-pack for Windows 2012R2
  - name: windows-2012r2
  # Windows 2008 RTM (not R2, no service pack)
  - name: windows-2008rtm
  # Windows 2008R2 SP1
  - name: windows-2008r2sp1
```

We always pick the highest released stable version that matches your regex, and follow the other `image_search` rules for preference.

#### availability_zone

The AWS [availability zone][region_docs] to use.  Only request the letter designation - will attach this to the region used.

If not specified, your instances will be placed in an AZ of AWS's choice in your region.

#### instance_type

The EC2 [instance type][instance_docs] (also known as size) to use.

The default is `t2.micro` or `t1.micro`, depending on whether the image is `hvm` or `paravirtual`. (`paravirtual` images are incompatible with `t2.micro`). When working with spots, you can provide an array of instance types in which case the driver will try each type until it can get a spot.

#### security_group_ids

An Array of EC2 [security groups][group_docs] which will be applied to the instance. If no security group is specified, a temporary group will be created automatically which allows SSH and WinRM (**>= 2.1.0**).

#### security_group_filter

The EC2 [security group(s)][group_docs] which will be applied to the instance, specified by name or tag. One or more groups can be specified.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

An example of usage:

```yaml
# By Name
security_group_filter:
  name:   'example-group-name'

# By Tag
security_group_filter:
  tag:   'Name'
  value: 'example-group-name'

# Multiple Groups
security_group_filter:
  - name: 'AWS-Egress'
  - tag: 'Name'
    value: 'MyApplicationSG'
  - tag: 'Name'
    value: 'MyApplicationDatabaseSG'
  - tag: 'Name'
    value: 'MyOtherSG'
```

#### security_group_cidr_ip

The EC2 [security group][group_docs] ip address, in CIDR block format, to use when creating the security group. Optionally, you can provide an array of ip addresses instead when having multiple ip addresses for the security group is desirable.

The default is "0.0.0.0/0".

#### region

**Required** The AWS [region][region_docs] to use.

If the environment variable `AWS_REGION` is populated that will be used.
Otherwise the default is `"us-east-1"`.

#### subnet_id

The EC2 [subnet][subnet_docs] to use.
When working with spots, you can provide an array in which case the driver will try each subnet until it can get a spot.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

#### subnet_filter

The EC2 [subnet][subnet_docs] to use, specified by tag.

The default is unset, or `nil`.

An example of usage:

```yaml
subnet_filter:
  tag:   'Name'
  value: 'example-subnet-name'
```

#### tags

The Hash of EC tag name/value pairs which will be applied to the instance.

The default is `{ "created-by" => "test-kitchen" }`.

#### metadata_options

The metadata options for the instance can be used to configure IMDSv2 and enable Instance Tags via metadata.

Example enforcing IMDSv2 and enabling Instance Tags via IMDS:

```yaml
metadata_options:
  http_tokens: 'required'
  http_put_response_hop_limit: 1
  instance_metadata_tags: 'enabled'
```

#### user_data

The user_data script or the path to a script to feed the instance.
Use bash to install dependencies or download artifacts before chef runs.
This is just for some cases. If you can do the stuff with chef, then do it with chef!

On linux instances the default is unset, or `nil`.

On Windows instances we specify a default that enables winrm and adds a non-administrator user specified in the `username` transport options to the Administrator's User Group.

#### iam_profile_name

The EC2 IAM profile name to use. The default is `nil`.

Note: The user, whose AWS credentials you have defined, not only needs `AmazonEC2FullAccess` permissions, but also the ability to execute `iam:PassRole`.
Hence, use a policy like below when using this option:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "iam:PassRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/RoleName"
        }
    ]
}
```

See [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/security/granting-permission-to-launch-ec2-instances-with-iam-roles-passrole-permission/) for more details.

#### spot_price

The price you bid in order to submit a spot request. An additional step will be required during the spot request process submission. If no price is set, it will use an on-demand instance. It accepts `on-demand` string in which case the price is the current on-demand price.

The default is `nil`.

#### instance_initiated_shutdown_behavior

Control whether an instance should `stop` or `terminate` when shutdown is initiated from the instance using an operating system command for system shutdown.

The default is `nil`.

#### block_duration_minutes

The [specified duration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#fixed-duration-spot-instances) for a spot instance, in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).
If no duration is set, the spot instance will remain active until it is terminated.

The default is `nil`.

#### http_proxy

Specify a proxy to send AWS requests through.  Should be of the format `http://<host>:<port>`.

The default is `ENV["HTTPS_PROXY"] || ENV["HTTP_PROXY"]`.  If you have these environment variables set and do not want to use a proxy when contacting aws set `http_proxy: nil`.

**Note** - The AWS command line utility allow you to specify [two proxies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-http-proxy.html), one for HTTP and one for HTTPS.  The AWS Ruby SDK only allows you to specify 1 proxy and because all requests are `https://` this proxy needs to support HTTPS.

#### ssl_verify_peer

If you need to turn off ssl certificate verification for HTTP calls made to AWS, set `ssl_verify_peer: false`.

#### retryable_tries

The `retryable_tries` propery allows you to set the number of retries to try when creating a new instance.
Combines with `retryable_sleep`.

The default is `60`.

#### retryable_sleep

The `retryable_sleep` propery sets how long to wait between tries when creating a new instance.
Combines with `retryable_tries`.

The default is `5`.

#### skip_cost_warning

The `skip_cost_warning` property allows for supressing the message that the instance will not be covered within the AWS free-tier.

The default is `false`.

#### elastic_network_interface_id

The `elastic_network_interface_id` property allows specifying the Elastic Network Interface ID which gets attached to the new instance created.

```yaml
driver:
  name: ec2
  elastic_network_interface_id: eni-0545666738adeed14
```

elastic_network_interface_id's have a format like eni-0545666738adeed14. You can only attach the network interface to instances in the same Availability Zone.

### Disk Configuration

#### `block_device_mappings`

A list of block device mappings for the machine.  An example of all available keys looks like:

```yaml
block_device_mappings:
  - device_name: /dev/sda
    ebs:
      volume_size: 20
      delete_on_termination: true
  - device_name: /dev/sdb
    ebs:
      volume_type: gp2
      virtual_name: test
      volume_size: 15
      delete_on_termination: true
      snapshot_id: snap-0015d0bc
  - device_name: /dev/sdc
    ebs:
      volume_size: 100
      delete_on_termination: true
      volume_type: io1
      iops: 100
```

See [Amazon EBS Volume Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) to find out more about volume types.

If you have a block device mapping with a `device_name` equal to the root storage device name on your [image](#config-image-id) then the provided mapping will replace the settings in the image.

If this is not provided it will use the default block_device_mappings from the AMI.

#### ebs_optimized

Option to launch EC2 instance with optimized EBS volume. See [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) to find out more about instance types that can be launched as EBS-optimized instances.

The default is `false`.

### Network and Communication Configuration

#### associate_public_ip

AWS does not automatically allocate public IP addresses for instances created within non-default [subnets][subnet_docs]. Set this option to `true` to force allocation of a public IP and associate it with the launched instance.

If you set this option to `false` when launching into a non-default [subnet][subnet_docs], Test Kitchen will be unable to communicate with the instance unless you have a VPN connection to your [Virtual Private Cloud][vpc_docs].

The default is `true` if you have configured a [subnet_id](#config-subnet-id), or `false` otherwise.

#### private_ip_address

The primary private IP address of your instance.

If you don't set this it will default to whatever DHCP address EC2 hands out.

#### interface

The place from which to derive the hostname for communicating with the instance. May be `dns`, `public`, `private`, `private_dns` or `id`.  If this is unset, the driver will derive the hostname by failing back in the following order:

1. DNS Name
2. Public IP Address
3. Private IP Address
4. Private DNS Name
5. Instance ID (Useful for [SSH through Session Manager][ssh_over_ssm])

The default is unset. Under normal circumstances, the lookup will return the `Private IP Address`.

If the `Private DNS Name` is preferred over the private IP, it must be specified in the `.kitchen.yml` file

```ruby
driver:
  interface: private_dns
```
