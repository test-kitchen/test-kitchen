  - `guestinfo.other.thing`
- `add_disks` - Array of disks to add to the VM (requires VirtualMachine.Config.AddNewDisk).
   Keys per disk: `type` (default: `thin`, other values: `flat`/`flat_lazy` or `flat_eager`), `size_mb` in MB (default: 10 GB)

The following `guest_customization` subkeys are available for general guest OS customization. Please note that this feature will significantly slow instance creation.

- `ip_address` - (*Optional*) String for configuring a static IPv4 address (performs validation as IPv4 only is supported at this time), if omitted DHCP will be used
- `gateway` - (*Optional*) Array for configuring IPv4 addresses as gateways
- `subnet_mask` - (*Optional*) String for configuring subnet mask, this is *required if* `ip_address` is set
- `dns_domain` - (*Required*) String for configuring DNS domain
- `timezone` - (*Required*) String for configuring timezone. Linux requires "Area/Location", while Windows requires a numeric value. Default: UTC
- `hostname` - (*Optional*) Hostname, will revert to `vm_name` if not given
- `dns_server_list` - (*Required*) Array for configuring DNS servers
- `dns_suffix_list` - (*Required*) Array for configuring DNS suffixes
- `timeout_task` - (*Optional*) Timeout for guest customization to finish. Default: 600 seconds
- `timeout_ip` - (*Optional*) Time to wait after successful customization to let vSphere catch a new static IP. Default: 30 seconds
- `continue_on_ip_conflict` - (*Optional*) Continue, even if a reachable host already uses the customized IP. Default: false

### Linux Guest Customization

Linux Example:

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: centos-7
    driver:
      # ...
      guest_customization:
        ip_address: 10.10.176.15
        gateway:
        - 17.10.176.1
        subnet_mask: 255.255.252.0
        dns_domain: 'example.com'
        timezone: 'US/Pacific'
        dns_server_list:
        - 8.8.8.8
        - 7.7.7.7
        dns_suffix_list:
        - 'test.example.com'
        - 'example.com'
        hostname: 'centos-7-kitchen'
```

Known customization issues:

- Sometimes the `libpath-class-file-stat-perl` package is missing which is needed for IP customization.
- `open-vm-tools` should be newer than 10.3.10 to avoid compatibility issues

### Windows Guest Customization

The following `guest_customization` subkeys are Windows specific:

- `org_name` - (*Optional*) Organization name for the Machine. Default: "TestKitchen"
- `product_id` - (*Required*) Product Key for the OS. Default: Attempt automatic selection, but this might fail
- `administrator_password` - (*Optional*) The plain text password to assign to the 'Administrator' account during customization

On guest customizations after Windows Vista the machine SID will be regenerated to avoid conflicts.

Windows Example:

```yaml
platforms:
  - name: windows-2019
    driver:
      # ...
      guest_customization:
        ip_address: 10.10.176.16
        gateway:
        - 17.10.176.1
        subnet_mask: 255.255.252.0
        dns_domain: 'example.com'
        timezone: 0x4
        dns_server_list:
        - 8.8.8.8
        - 7.7.7.7
        dns_suffix_list:
        - 'test.example.com'
        - 'example.com'
        hostname: 'win2019-kitchen'
        product_id: 00000-00000-00000-00000-00000
```

## Clone types

### Clone type: full

This takes a VM or template, copies the whole disk and then boots up the machine. Default mode of operation.

Required prilveges:

- Datastore.AllocateSpace
- Network.Assign
- Resource.AssignVMToPool
- VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOn
- VirtualMachine.Provisioning.Clone
- VirtualMachine.Provisioning.DeployTemplate

- VirtualMachine.Config.Annotation (depending on `vm_customization` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.CPUCount (depending on `vm_customization` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.Memory (depending on `vm_customization` parameters)
- VirtualMachine.Config.EditDevice (if `network_name` is used)
- DVSwitch.CanUse (if `network_name` is used with dVS/lVS)
- DVPortgroup.CanUse (if `network_name` is used with dVS/lVS)

### Clone mode: linked

Instead of a full copy, "linked" uses delta disks to speed up the cloning process and uses many fewer IO operations. After creation of the delta disks, the machine is booted up and writes only to its delta disks.

The `template` parameter has to reference a VM (a template will not work) and a snapshot must be present. Otherwise, the driver will fall back to creating a full clone.

Depending on the underlying storage system, performance may vary greatly compared to full clones.

Required privileges: (see "Clone mode: full")

### Clone mode: instant

The instant clone feature has been available under the name "VMFork" in earlier vSphere versions, but without a proper public API. With version 6.7.0, instant clones became an official feature. They work by not only using a delta disk like linked clones, but also share memory with the source machine. Because of sharing memory contents, the new machines are already booted up after cloning.

Prerequisites:

- vCenter version 6.7.0 or higher
- vSphere Hypervisor (aka ESXi) version 6.7.0 or higher
- VMware Tools installed and running
- a running source virtual machine (`template` parameter)
- for Linux, currently only `dhclient` is supported as DHCP client

Limitations:

- A new VM is always on the same host because of memory sharing
- The current driver supports only the "Frozen Source VM" workflow, which is more efficient than the "Running Source VM" version

Freezing the source VM:

- Login to the machine
- Execute the freeze operation, for example via `vmtoolsd --cmd "instantclone.freeze"`
- The machine does not execute any CPU instructions after this point

New clones resume from exactly the frozen point in time and also resume CPU activity automatically. The OS level network adapters get rescanned automatically
to pick up MAC address changes, which requires the privileges to use the Guest Operations API and login credentials (`vm_username`/`vm_password`).

Architectural description see <https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2018/04/new-instant-clone-architecture-in-vsphere-6-7-part-1.html>

Required privileges in addition to "Clone mode: full":

- VirtualMachine.Config.EditDevice
- VirtualMachine.Inventory.CreateFromExisting
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query

## Active Discovery Mode

This mode is used to speed up provisioning of kitchen machines as much as possible. One of the limiting factors despite actual provisioning time
(which can be improved using the linked/instant clone modes) is waiting for the VM to return its IP address. While VMware tools are usually available and
responding within 10-20 seconds, sending back IP/OS information to vCenter can take additional 30-40 seconds easily.

Active mode invokes OS specific commands for IP retrieval as soon as the VMware Tools are responding, by using the Guest Operations Manager
feature within the tools agent. Depending on the OS, a command to determine the IP will be executed using Bash (Linux) or CMD (Windows) and the
resulting output parsed. While the driver has sensible default commands, you can set your own via the `active_discovery_command` directive on the
platform level.

Active mode can speed up tests and pipelines by up to 30 seconds, but may fail due to asynchronous OS interaction in some instances. If retrieving the IP
fails for some reason, the VMware Tools provided data is used as fallback.

Required privileges:

- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute
- VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query

Linux default:
`ip address show scope global | grep global | cut -b10- | cut -d/ -f1`

Windows default:
`sleep 5 & ipconfig`

## Benchmarking

To get some insight into the performance of your environment with different configurations, some simple benchmark functionality was built in. When you
enable this via the `benchmark` property, data gets appended to a CSV file (`benchmark_file` property) and printed to standard out (`-l debug` on CLI)

This file includes a header line describing the different fields such as the value of `template`, `clone_type` and `active_discovery` plus the different
steps within cloning a VM. The timing of steps is relative to each other and followed by a column with the total number of seconds for the whole cloning
operation.

## 1:1 NAT Support

Due to limited IPv4 space, some enterprises use NAT to transform the VM IPs into a routable IP. As the driver cannot detect such a NAT automatically,
but has to rely on the IP retrieved by the Guest OS, this has to be handled manually.

Example:

```yaml
driver:
  # ... other settings
  network_name: TEST-NET
  transform_ip: "ip.sub '172.16.', '10.25.'"
```

This example reassociates the VM to the separate VMware network "TEST-NET", which would provision addresses from 172.16.x.x to the VMs. In between
this network and the developers, there is a router with 1:1 NAT configured so that those machines will be reachable as 10.25.x.x externally.

Any passed Ruby code will be executed with the `ip` variable (as discovered by VMware) available. The returned value will then be used as new IP.
As you can use arbitrary Ruby code, it is possible to do complex arithmetics or even implement remote API/IPAM lookups.
